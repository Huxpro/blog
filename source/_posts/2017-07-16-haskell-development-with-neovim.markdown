  After a year and a half of using Haskell on and off, I've finally settled on a
  set of high-quality development and editor tools, using Stack and Neovim.
---

Configuring an editor for a new language is a double-edged sword: it's intensely
satisfying when done, but takes time away from diving into the language itself!
After using Haskell for a little over a year, I've settled on a high-quality set
of editor plugins. They're simple, powerful, and all play nicely together.

<!-- more -->

## Requirements

I use [Haskell Stack][stack] exclusively. Stack's goal is reproducible builds,
which means that in general, things Just Work.

I also use [Neovim][neovim], rather than normal Vim. Usually, my justification
is ideological rather than technical. This Haskell setup, however, requires
Neovim. Fear not! Neovim is feature-packed and also very stable. I love Neovim,
and I'll be writing more about why in a future post.

By the way, new to Vim plugins? I happen to have [just the post for
you][vim-as-an-ide]!

<!-- TODO(jez): Update with link to Neovim post -->

## Overview

We're going to move in order of increasing complexity. That said, even the most
"complex" plugin here is actually quite painless to set up. By the end, we'll
have a complete development experience! Coming up:

- syntax highlighting & indentation (**[haskell-vim][]**)
- auto-formatting & style (**[hindent][], [stylish-haskell][]**)
- quickfix and sign column icons (**using [ale][]**) for:
  - linter style suggestions (**hlint**)
  - compiler errors and warnings (**ghc-mod**)
- Type inspection, REPL integration, and more! (**[intero-neovim][]**)

If you just want to browse the final configuration for these plugins and tools,
skip to the bottom. For now, let's start at the top.

<!-- TODO(jez) Demonstrate everything with an asciicast -->

## Syntax Highlighting & Indentation

- **Plugin**: [haskell-vim][haskell-vim][^neovimhaskell]

Vim's default Haskell filetype plugin is pretty lack luster. Everything is blue,
except for strings which are colored like comments and keywords which are
colored like constants. Indentation is wonky in some edge cases, and isn't
configurable.

This plugin corrects all that. It's the filetype plugin for Haskell that
**should** ship with Vim.

`haskell-vim` lets me configure certain parts of the indentation, too. This is
important, because it lets me use my own personal style. I've included my
settings at the end of this post.

## Auto-formatting and Indentation

- **Plugin**: [vim-hindent][]
- **Tool**: `stack install hindent`
- **Tool**: `stack install stylish-haskell`

For small projects, I like using my own, personal style. However, for larger
projects it's a burden to ask contributors to learn my personal style. In these
cases, tools come into play.

`go fmt` famously solved this problem for Golang by building the formatting tool
into the compiler. For Haskell, there's [hindent][][^one-tool]. `hindent` can be
installed through Stack, and `vim-hindent` shims it.

But I said I'm partial to my own style in personal projects. There's another
Haskell formatter that's much less invasive: [stylish-haskell][]. It basically
only works with `import`s, `case` branches, and record fields, aligning them
vertically. And in fact, it's possible to use this alongside `hindent`.

With these three tools, I can pick the right hammer for the job:

- **Bare hands**: manually control the style myself
- **Normal hammer**: run `stylish-haskell` only
- **Sledgehammer**: run `hindent` only
- **Sledgehammer, then band-aid**: run `hindent`, then `stylish-haskell`

Getting them to play together requires a bit of config, which you can see below.

## Quickfix & Sign Columns

- **Plugin**: [ale][]
- **Tool**: `stack install hlint`
- **Tool**: `stack build ghc-mod`
  - N.B.: This is *build* not *install* here[^build].

This is where the Neovim dependency starts to creep up, though Vim 8 is an
acceptable alternative for now. ALE stands for "Asynchronous Lint Engine." It's
like Syntastic, but asynchronous[^neomake].

ALE ships with a number of Haskell integrations by default. For example, it will
be able to show errors if all that's installed is Stack. I prefer using two of
these: `hlint` and `ghc-mod`.

- `hlint` is a linter for Haskell. It warns me when I try to do silly things
  like `if x then True else False`.
- `ghc-mod` is a tool that can check files for compiler errors.

There's minimal config once everything's installed. We just have to tell ALE not
to use anything else (by telling it to use these two explicitly).

## Intero: The PiÃ¨ce de RÃ©sistance

- **Plugin**: [intero-neovim][]

Intero is a complete development program for Haskell. Probably the best way to
introduce it is with this asciicast:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/128416">
    <img
      width="700px"
      alt="Intero for Neovim asciicast"
      src="https://asciinema.org/a/128416.png">
  </a>
</p>

Intero is designed for stack, sets itself up automatically, has point-and-click
type information, and lets you jump to definitions. On top of it all, it uses
Neovim to communicate back and forth with a terminal buffer so that you get a
GHCi buffer **right inside Neovim**. For Emacs users, this is nothing new I'm
sure. But it continues to blow my mind ðŸ˜®.

Developing with the REPL in mind helps me write code better. Only top-level
bindings are exposed in the REPL, so I write more small, testable functions.
See here for more reasons [why the REPL is awesome][haskell-repl].

On top of providing access to the REPL, Intero provides about a dozen
convenience commands that shell out to the REPL backend. Being able to reload
your code in the REPL---from Vim, with a single keystroke!---is a huge boon when
developing.

Intero takes a little getting used to, so be sure to read the docs for some
sample workflows. Intero sets up no mappings by default, so check mine out
below. I also flip two config variables to make Intero a little faster.

## The Eagerly-Awaited Config

```vim

let g:haskell_indent_if = 2

```

## Wrap Up

With these tools, I feel empowered (rather than hindered) when I sit down to work
with Haskell.

- The entire setup Stack, so things Just Work.
  - As a consequence, everything works with the implicit global Stack project!
- It scales up in power:
  - From simple syntax highlighting, manual indentation...
  - to an indentation sledgehammer and a **REPL embeded in the editor**!
- I can take full advantage of all my tools working together, leading to cleaner
  code and fewer frustrations.

Now that I'm finally at a point where I can stop fretting about my Haskell
setup, I'll have more time to explore the language and write about my
experience.

Haskell-the-language isn't quite on the same level as SML-the-language, but it's
far and above when comparing by tooling support. I'm looking forward to taking
advantage of that!

[^recomp]: Tip: sometimes it's handy for [force a complete recompile](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/3d29b8c/doc/faq.md#why-doesnt-stack-rebuild-my-project-when-i-specify---ghc-options-on-the-command-line).

[^logo]: If you still aren't convinced, the [Neovim logo](https://github.com/neovim/neovim#readme) makes for a much better laptop sticker than Vim's.

[^neovimhaskell]: While listed under "neovimhaskell" on GitHub, this plugin works with normal Vim, too.

[^one-tool]: Chris Done explains the appeal of solving style issues with tooling for Haskell well. The moral of the story is that hindent version 5 ships with only the most popular style formatter in an effort to arrive at a singular Haskell style: <http://chrisdone.com/posts/hindent-5>

[^build]: We want to install `ghc-mod` once in every project. You can do it globally, but it might get out of sync with your current project.

[^neomake]: Some people are familiar with Neomake for this task. However, Neomake is much more minimal than ALE. Neomake basically only builds, whereas ALE is more configurable and hackable.

There are LaTeX document classes for typesetting books, articles, exams,
presentations, and more. Now, there's one for homework assignments, too.

<!-- more -->

## [Source][homework]

Check out and download the source [on GitHub][homework].

## What

This is a LaTeX document class. That means you use it with
`\documentclass{homework}` at the top of the document. It provides a document
layout and some helper commands that make working with questions easy.

## Installation

Certainly the easiest way to start using this template is to copy the .cls file
to your computer in the same directory as your LaTeX project directory.

A better way to install this template is to fork [the above
repository][homework] and then clone that fork to a particular folder on your
computer:

```bash Install
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/latex-hw-template
```

Then, whenever you need to use the template, you can copy the template wherever.
Also, if there are ever any updates, you can simply run

```bash Update
git pull
```

to update the template.

### Preferred Installation

The _best_ way to install this file is to [follow the instructions
here][install], keeping in mind that you're trying to install a `.cls` file
instead of three `.sty` files.

## Usage

See the [homework.tex][homework.tex] file for an exhaustive list of usage
examples. There are also comments explaining features for which there are no
examples given.

The result is the following:

The class file also has a bunch of helper `\usepackage`s that you might want to
take a look at in [homework.cls][homework.cls].

For your convenience, the file [template.tex][template.tex] is a nearly-empty
LaTeX file that contains the bare essentials to get started using the homework
class.

### `\question`

To start a question, just type `\question`. It will add the text "Question #"
with a line underneath to the document. If you'd like to change "Question" to
something else, use

```tex Change the Question Type
\renewcommand{\questiontype}{Whatever You Want}
% Now questions will be titled "Whatever You Want #"
```

Similarly, if you ever need to skip numbers, you can do

```tex Non-contiguous Question Numbers
\setcounter{\questionCounter}{<target number - 1>}
```

So, to skip to the 10th question, `<target number - 1>` = 9.

See [homework.tex][homework.tex] for more.

### `\question*`

Some classes like to give their homework questions fancy names. If this is the
case, you can use `\question*{The Question's Name}` to make a named question.

See [homework.tex][homework.tex] for more.

### Question Parts

Another common thing on homework assignments is to have multi-part questions. To
deal with these, use the form

```tex Lettered Question Parts
\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart
    This will be part (a).
  \questionpart
    This will be part (b).
\end{alphaparts}
```
or
```tex Numbered Question Parts
\begin{arabicparts}
  \questionpart
    This will be part x.1.
  \questionpart
    This will be part x.2.
\end{arabicparts}
```

See [homework.tex][homework.tex] for more.

### Induction Proofs

In math classes, induction proofs come up a lot, and they almost always have the
same form: base case, induction hypothesis, and induction step.

```tex Induction Environment
\begin{induction}
  \basecase
    This is my fancy base case.
  \indhyp
    Assume some claim.
  \indstep
    Finish off the proof
\end{induction}
```

## Markdown

One of my favorite features of this document class is that it redefines the
`\section` macros. This means you can use tools like Markdown, which have a
concise syntax, together with a tool like [`pandoc`][pandoc] to convert Markdown
into LaTeX. As an example, consider that we have the Markdown:

```plain my-homework.md
#

This is my first answer.

#

This is my next answer.

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

Running `pandoc -f markdown -t latex my-homework.md` will output

```tex Convert markdown to LaTeX
% $ pandoc -f markdown -t latex my-homework.md
\section{}\label{section}

This is my first answer.

\section{}\label{section-1}

This is my next answer.

\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
```

And since `\section` is the same thing as \question, we're golden, and this
compiles as we'd want it to. Throw it into the blank
[template.tex][template.tex] file included in the repo, and you've got yourself
a typeset homework.

I've make a lot of other LaTeX-related posts. Be sure to [check them out][latex]
as well! My hope is that you find something that makes developing LaTeX just
that much easier.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve already written about how I develop LaTeX offline in Vim using GNU Make.
Recently, though, I found a tool that implements another feature that GUI
editors had to themselves: splitting panes.</p>

<h2><a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">Offline LaTeX Development</a></h2>

<p>If you missed it, check out my previous post here before reading on. There&rsquo;s a
lot of handy stuff there!</p>

<h2>Split Panes</h2>

<p>Out of the box, tools like ShareLaTeX and TeXShop feature split pane editing:
you can have your LaTeX on one half of the screen and the PDF on the other.
Previously, I justified not having this feature with the reasoning that the
<code>:WV</code> binding (something I explained <a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">here</a>) immediately opened up the
PDF and the windows switched.</p>

<p>However, I read about a tool called <a href="http://ianyh.com/amethyst/">Amethyst</a> on Hacker News the
other day and immediately realized it&rsquo;s potential for improving my LaTeX setup.
Amethyst is a tool that strives to be a tiling window manager like xmonad for OS
X. At times it falls short of this goal, but for the most part it works really
well. Just open up two apps, like MacVim and Preview, and it&rsquo;ll show them
side-by-side with no added effort. There are also plenty of keybindings to
manipulate the window arrangements.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what the new setup looks like:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/latex-amethyst.png"><img src="/images/latex-amethyst.png"></a></p>

<p>After looking into it a little more, it looks like there are other OS X tools
for spitting the screen into two panes, like <a href="http://www.bettertouchtool.net/">BetterTouchTool</a>, though I
haven&rsquo;t actually tried any of them out.</p>

    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/2014/09/28/setting-up-mobaxterm-for-ssh-on-windows/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-28T14:11:05-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2014/09/28/setting-up-mobaxterm-for-ssh-on-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For an optimal SSH experience, your best best is to use Linux or Mac OS X. However, if you&rsquo;re dead-set on using Windows, MobaXterm has the best overall experience. This post guides you through setting it up and outlines some of its coolest features.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Download and Install</h2>

<p>The download and installation procedure for MobaXterm is pretty standard.</p>

<h3>1. Navigate to MobaXterm&rsquo;s Site</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to download the Home Edition, so find its link on the download page, or just go <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html">here</a>. You&rsquo;ll see two options: one to install as a system-wide application (labelled &ldquo;installer&rdquo;), and one for installing to a flash drive (labelled &ldquo;portable edition&rdquo;). Unless you&rsquo;d really like to install to a flash drive, click the former and run the file once it&rsquo;s downloaded.</p>

<h3>2. Install</h3>

<p>I had trouble running the installer when I first downloaded it; Windows complained that the app was from an unrecognized publisher, so I had to click &ldquo;More info&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Run anyway&rdquo; to get the installer to run (this was on Windows 8, the process might be different if you run into this issue).</p>

<p>Installing MobaXterm is simple. Just click through all the menus; no special setup is required here.</p>

<h3>3. Configure Your SSH Session</h3>

<p>When you first log in, you&rsquo;ll see a prompt where you can directly SSH as you would on a normal terminal.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/mobaxterm-ssh.png"><img src="/images/mobaxterm-ssh.png" title="SSH Prompt" ></a></p>

<p>If you type <code>ssh &lt;andrewid&gt;@unix.andrew.cmu.edu</code>, it will prompt you for your CMU password and then log you in. The program will also ask if you want to save your password. In the free version, it doesn&rsquo;t allow you to encrypt your stored passwords with a master password, so they&rsquo;re stored in the clear (this means anyone can read these if they got control of your computer). With this in mind, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to allow it to save your password, but I suppose no one&rsquo;s stopping you.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/mobaxterm-password.png"><img src="/images/mobaxterm-password.png" title="Save Password Prompt" ></a></p>

<p>This process of typing out your username and hostname every time you want to SSH can get annoying, though. MobaXterm allows you to save sessions so that you can easily log in without typing <code>ssh &lt;andrewid&gt;@unix.andrew.cmu.edu</code> each time.</p>

<p>To create a new session, click the &ldquo;Session&rdquo; button in the top left.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/mobaxterm-new-session.png"><img src="/images/mobaxterm-new-session.png" title="New Session" ></a></p>

<p>Then you&rsquo;ll see a screen that allows you to enter the settings for that session.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/mobaxterm-configure-session.png"><img src="/images/mobaxterm-configure-session.png" title="Configure New Session" ></a></p>

<p>The fields and values you&rsquo;ll need to populate are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Remote host</strong>: <code>unix.andrew.cmu.edu</code></li>
<li><strong>Specify username</strong>: check the box, then <code>&lt;Your-AndrewID&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>Port</strong>: 22</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also choose a bunch of other settings for this session. Feel free to peruse them and see if there&rsquo;s something you want to change (note that these settings will only be used when you use this session to log in). You might want to change the &ldquo;Session name&rdquo; to something more concise.</p>

<p>After that, click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and your session will appear in the panel on the left under &ldquo;Saved sessions&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Cool MobaXterm Features</h2>

<p>This section lists a few features that MobaXterm does better than other SSH options like PuTTY.</p>

<p>First, MobaXterm has tabs and splits, which make managing your connections to a remote server much more enjoyable.</p>

<p>MobaXterm also has more sophisticated color options. Granted, it&rsquo;s still not as good as most Linux or Mac OS X terminal emulators. Out of the box, the colors are more pleasant than the default PuTTY color scheme. There are also 4 other pre-installed colors schemes, including <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized Light and Solarized Dark</a>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how much of a different having a &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; terminal is. Given the amount of time you&rsquo;ll be spending in your terminal, being able to read its text is a must. Also check out the rest of the settings. There will very likely be a few things you&rsquo;d like to tweak that make the interface make more sense to you, which in turn will make you less frustrated when trying to get work done.</p>

<p>MobaXterm comes with a built in SCP client. This means you can transfer files between your remote server (like Andrew Unix) and your personal computer with the simplicity of a graphical, click and drag interface if you prefer. This is an alternative to WinSCP that&rsquo;s built into MobaXterm.</p>

<p>It also has a built in X server, which means that you can start programs on the remote host that have graphical displays. For example, this is useful if you have an assignment that requires you to write a program that manipulates images and view the results.</p>

<h2>Shameless Plug</h2>

<p>While all these features are great, ssh is a program that was meant to be used on Unix-based systems. I personally switched from Windows + Ubuntu to Mac OS X before coming to college, and it was one of the best decisions I made. If Mac OS X is a bit much for you, though, I strongly encourage you to install Linux, using either a VM or a dual-boot configuration. Doing programming and development work in a Linux environment makes nearly every task simpler than trying to do it on Windows.</p>

<h2>Obligatory Existential/Meta Section</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know what prompted me to suddenly become interested in maintaining an up to date system. Maybe it was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cmuscs/permalink/727878180603546/">this post</a> of Arch Linux horror stories. Maybe it was the release of <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/RelNotes/2.0.0.txt">git 2.0</a>, which introduces a lot of cool new features and deprecates a lot of others. Who knows, maybe it was influenced by Heartbleed and the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt">host</a> <a href="http://grahamcluley.com/2014/06/feedly-blackmail-ddos/">of other</a> <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/03/02/security-notice-service-wide-password-reset/">high-profile</a> security vulnerabilities and hacks that have sprung up lately. It&rsquo;s probably a combination of all of these. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

<p>For the impatient among us, here&rsquo;s the code, which is also available <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_profile#L16-L42">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_profile#L153-L178">here</a> amongst all the code for <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">all my dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll note the use of a touch file (created in line 2 of the first snippet if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist). If this file is 24 hours old, each time this code is run an alert will be printed. Since this code is running inside of my <code>.bash_profile</code>, that means that every time I open a terminal on a 24-hour-old system, I see the update message.</p>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll note that I&rsquo;ve defined a function called <code>update</code> which is actually misnamed. This function merely checks for available updates instead of actually performing the updates, logging those packages, gems, and formulae it finds that are out of date. For my purposes, I only need to update brew, check for formulae updates, update rbenv, and check for gem updates. Obviously though, given that there is a way to programmatically check something for updates, plugging that code in here would check it as well. This means that this method is very easy to customize and extend for various needs.</p>

<h2>Rant</h2>

<p>I was planning on checking pip for updates as well, but pip is kind of not even good. To give you an idea, to check all the packages brew manages for updates, you type <code>brew outdated</code>, and it will list the formula name, current version number, and newest version number. Meanwhile, back in the land of pip, no such functionality exists (at least, simple functionality, and functionality that I could find. If you&rsquo;d like to correct me, be my guest!). I&rsquo;m sure that this script will grow as I come to manage more and more pieces of software on my system and others.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about what I&rsquo;ve done here, or you catch some bugs, be sure to comment below or file an issue on GitHub! I&rsquo;d love to hear what you have to say.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-07T12:00:39-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2014/06/07/molokai-an-iterm2-color-scheme</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/tomasr">tomasr</a>&rsquo;s vim color scheme <a href="https://github.com/tomasr/molokai">molokai</a> for a long time now. Recently I decided that the default iTerm2 colors were a little lack luster, so I ported over the main colors from this theme into an iTerm2 theme.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes#molokai"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Installation</a></h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have your iTerm2 colors configured or you&rsquo;re looking for a change, you should definitely check out <a href="https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes">iTerm2-Color-Schemes</a>, a GitHub repo by <a href="https://github.com/mbadolato">mbadolato</a> filled with tons of themes he&rsquo;s ported, collected, and been given.</p>

<p>You can see and install the <a href="https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes#molokai">Molokai theme</a> there.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have too many good screenshots of this theme that aren&rsquo;t vim because I&rsquo;m actually using <a href="https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized">solarized</a> dircolors for colorizing the output of my <code>ls</code> and related commands. However, there are still plenty of tools I use which resort to default ANSI colors to colorize their output, like <code>git</code> and <code>brew</code>. You can see a <code>git log</code> command along side a table of all ANSI color combinations resulting from this theme (this table can be a bit overwhelming: it&rsquo;s best to just look at the first two columns to get an idea of what the colors really look like).</p>

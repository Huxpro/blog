    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some hidden gems in my dotfiles. This is a post to showcase them,
putting them front and center.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I often tell people &ldquo;oh, and you can also go check out my dotfiles repository
for more cool configurations&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m giving out dotfiles advice. If someone
gave me this advice, I know I wouldn&rsquo;t follow up, even if I had the utmost awe
for the recommender. Drudging through config files isn&rsquo;t all that fun, even
though they can do fun things. Why not get rid of the drudgery?</p>

<p>This post is designed to bring the coolest parts of my dotfiles to the top. It&rsquo;s
organized by topic, so feel free to skip around.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: throughout this post, I&rsquo;ll be linking to my dotfiles <em>at a specific
commit</em> on GitHub. While this solves the problem of line-level links breaking on
updates, it means that you&rsquo;ll almost certainly be looking at out-dated code.
Make sure to check out the corresponding file on the <code>master</code> branch for the
most up-to-date version.</p>

<p>Also, I <a href="/2015/03/09/getting-started-with-rcm/">just wrote</a> about one of my biggest dotfile hacks: using rcm
to keep my dotfiles in sync across machines. Be sure to give it a read if you&rsquo;re
running into that problem.</p>

<h2><code>tmux</code></h2>

<p>I have a lot of cool stuff going on in my <code>.tmux.conf</code></p>

<ul>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/0ca7dfb042e8d0e6790e7142487812517b5a4209/tmux.conf#L1-L4">bind the prefix key to <code>C-f</code></a>, something which I haven&rsquo;t seen
many people do.  I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with it conflicting with commonly
used shortcuts, and it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to press (compared with the common
options of <code>C-a</code> and <code>C-b</code>)</li>
<li>I integrate with two Vim plugins:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/0ca7dfb042e8d0e6790e7142487812517b5a4209/tmux.conf#L18-L27">vim-tmux-navigator</a>, which lets you jump between vim
splits and tmux splits as if they were the same thing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/0ca7dfb042e8d0e6790e7142487812517b5a4209/tmux.conf#L48-L49">tmuxline</a>, which makes my tmux status bar look just like Vim with
vim-airline (it even pulls down the colors from your Vim configuration!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><code>dircolors</code></h2>

<p>I use the GNU <code>dircolors</code> command to change the colors output by the <code>ls</code>
program. After running <code>brew install coreutils</code> on OS X, I&rsquo;m able to see the
colors thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/0ca7dfb042e8d0e6790e7142487812517b5a4209/dircolors">this file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/0ca7dfb042e8d0e6790e7142487812517b5a4209/host-Jacobs-MacBook-Air/util/host.sh#L19-L21">this snippet</a> in my zshrc.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyz/dircolors-solarized/master/img/screen-dircolors-in-iTerm2-solarized_dark.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyz/dircolors-solarized/master/img/screen-dircolors-in-iTerm2-solarized_dark.png</a>&#8221;><img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyz/dircolors-solarized/master/img/screen-dircolors-in-iTerm2-solarized_dark.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyz/dircolors-solarized/master/img/screen-dircolors-in-iTerm2-solarized_dark.png</a>&#8221;></a></p>

<p>(image from the <a href="https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized">dircolors-solarized</a> repository on GitHub)</p>

<h2><code>gitconfig</code></h2>

<p>I talked about this <a href="/2015/01/16/mastering-git-log-for-collaboration/">in a previous post</a>, but I have some <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-Jacobs-MacBook-Air/gitconfig#L20-L24">special
settings</a> in my global gitconfig for adding colored decoration to git
log commands.</p>

<h2><code>aklog cs.cmu.edu</code></h2>

<p>For my friends at CMU, I have <code>aklog cs.cmu.edu</code> in <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-andrew/util/host.zshenv#L1">my
~/.zshenv</a>, which gets run even when you log in interactively
(like what happens when you <code>scp</code> something), so that I can copy files from my
local machine to the SCS AFS space, which is useful for doing things like making
handins. Note that the file linked to above is a host-specific file that only
&ldquo;exists&rdquo; for me on Andrew machines. You can read more about my setup <a href="/2015/03/09/getting-started-with-rcm/">in my
previous post</a>.</p>

<h2>zsh-syntax-highlighting</h2>

<p>I use a <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/util/misc.zsh#L79-L80">zsh plugin</a> to syntax highlight my commands as I type them
on the command line, similar to how the fish shell does it. It does various
things, like coloring the command red or green based on whether it exists,
underlines filenames that exist, highlights filenames that might be misspelled
in yellow, highlights built-ins like <code>if</code> and <code>for</code> in orange, etc.</p>

<h2>Automatic Dotfile Updates</h2>

<p>I wrote a pretty robust script that reminds me to update my dotfiles and my
system regularly. All it does is remind me to check for system updates once
every 24 hours, but it works so well that I had updated my system <code>bash</code> version
before I even read about Shell Shock!</p>

<p>The relevant links are <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/util/auto-update.sh">here</a> for the core script that I <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/zshrc#L44-L45">source in
my zshrc</a>, and then the following host specific links:
- <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-Jacobs-MacBook-Air/util/host.sh#L69-L86">here</a> for my MacBook
- <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-ghost.zimmerman.io/util/host.sh#L24-L31">here</a> for my Ubuntu VPS</p>

<h2>Shell aliases</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that my whole <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/util/aliases.sh"><code>aliases.sh</code></a> file is golden, but if
you&rsquo;re looking for some specific things I like about it, check out my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/util/aliases.sh#L75-L86"><code>git log</code></a>
aliases, which I wrote about <a href="/2015/01/16/mastering-git-log-for-collaboration/">here</a>, and my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/util/aliases.sh#L44-L45"><code>chromemem</code></a> alias, which I wrote about <a href="/2014/12/29/google-chrome-a-memory-hog/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Ruby Virtualenvs</h2>

<p>I wrote about how I use <a href="/2014/12/22/ruby-virtualenvs/">Python Virtualenvs to sandbox Ruby
gems</a>, a post in which I dropped some snippets that you can
use to configure virtualenvwrapper to work with Ruby projects. I actually went
ahead and <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/tree/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-Jacobs-MacBook-Air/virtualenvs">fed those files right into rcm</a>, so they&rsquo;ll always be available if I
ever get a new laptop.</p>

<h2><code>ssh</code></h2>

<p>My hostname on every machine I ssh to for school is <code>jezimmer</code>, but there are
countless servers I can ssh into (7 for <code>unix.andrew.cmu.edu</code>, 99+ for
<code>ghc*.ghc.andrew.cmu.edu</code>, 10 for 15-213, the list goes on). <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/host-Jacobs-MacBook-Air/ssh/config#L7-L19">These
lines</a> enable me to ssh to any of those machines with just a
hostname, and the username is assumed to be <code>jezimmer</code>.</p>

<h2>iTerm2</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to show for this one, but in Preferences > General of iTerm2,
you can opt to load your iTerm2 preferences from a specific location. I&rsquo;ve set
this to <code>/Users/jake/.dotfiles</code>, which means that my iTerm2 settings are always
written to my <code>.dotfiles/</code> directory. If I ever make changes to iTerm2, they get
propagated as changes that Git picks up on and which I subsequently check into
Git history.</p>

<h2>Vim</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m in love with my Vim setup. If you&rsquo;re looking for help getting started
configuring Vim, you should checkout the <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim plugins workshop I put
together</a>, which gets you started with a &ldquo;fully-configured&rdquo; Vim
setup. Once you think you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; that and you&rsquo;re ready for more, here are
a list of things I&rsquo;m proud of in my <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/vimrc#L65-L67"><code>set breakindent</code></a> A feature new in Vim 7.4, this allows you to
align wrapped text at the same indentation level as the preceding text.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/vimrc#L100-L106">these mappings</a>, which let me move around (move up and down in
particular) in long lines just as if they were short.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/eba0202443de6bcc171dbe6bc133fa9fe02357f7/vimrc#L90-L91">this mapping</a>, which lets me open Vim help pages in new tabs</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only highlighted a fraction of my configuration files, but I think I&rsquo;ve
managed to capture a good portion of them. If you thought that one of these
snippets was useful, are having trouble getting something to work, or have
something interesting to share, leave a comment below!</p>

    <updated>2015-03-03T00:01:19-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2015/03/03/vim-as-an-ide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took some screenshots to accompany my <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim as an IDE</a> repo on GitHub.
This is by no means a complete walkthrough! It&rsquo;s just a reference for those who
are curious if they installed everything correctly. This is what my system looks
like for me after each step.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/0673f0c">Create vimrc file</a></h2>

<p>This is what Vim should look like immediately after opening it:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-01.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-01.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>And right after adding the two lines:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-02.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-02.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>2. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/dff7da3">Add some general settings</a></h2>

<p>After you add these settings, your <code>~/.vimrc</code> should look like this when opened
in Vim:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-03_1.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-03_1.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>3. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/fc77b04">Enable the mouse</a></h2>

<p>To enable the mouse, you&rsquo;ll have to figure out where the appropriate setting is
in your terminal emulator. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of where it is in iTerm2 on OS X.</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-03.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-03.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>4. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/1186be2">Set up Vundle boilerplate</a></h2>

<p>If you add the changes introduced at this step before installing Vundle, you&rsquo;ll
get an error that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-04.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-04.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Otherwise, this should be the result of running <code>vim +PluginInstall</code> to install
Vundle for the first time:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-05.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-05.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Remember, you can use <code>:qall</code> to quit Vim after installing plugins.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/457f2e2">Make Vim look good</a></h2>

<p>Your experience might diverge a little bit from these screenshots if you choose
a different colorscheme because I&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re setting everything up using
Solarized Dark. If you&rsquo;re on a Mac and you&rsquo;ve imported the iTerm2 colorschemes,
you should be able to find the Solarized Dark theme here:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-06.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-06.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Making that change should make Vim turn these colors:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-07.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-07.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Next up is changing your font to a Powerline patched font. If you downloaded and
installed Menlo for Powerline correctly, you should be able to set it using this
panel in the preferences:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-08.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-08.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, running <code>vim +PluginInstall</code> to install the Solarized Vim colorscheme
and vim-airline:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-09.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-09.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the Vim solarized plugind does to our <code>~/.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-10.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-10.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>If you chose to install a Powerline patched font, you can let vim-airline use
cooler arrows by uncommenting the line highlighted in this screenshot above, to
make Vim look like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-11.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-11.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>6. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/b7ff90c">Plugins NERDTree and NERDTree Tabs</a></h2>

<p>This will be the last time that I demonstrate running <code>vim +PluginInstall</code>,
because they&rsquo;ll all basically look the same from here on out:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-12.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-12.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed NERDTree and NERDTree Tabs (and added the settings I
listed for them), you should be able to type <code>\t</code> to bring up something that
looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-13.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-13.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>7. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/144f979">Plugin Syntastic</a></h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed Syntastic, it should syntax highlight your errors by
displaying little marks next to the offending lines:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-14.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-14.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>You can see that we&rsquo;ve forgotten a semi-colon, and Syntastic is pointing that
out for us.</p>

<p>As I was making these screenshots, I realized that I forgot to include a setting
in the right place. It&rsquo;s fine if you work through the whole workshop, but if you
pick and choose things, namely if you don&rsquo;t follow the steps for <code>vim-gitgutter</code>
eventually, you&rsquo;ll end up with this weird highlighting in the sign column. To
disable this highlighting, you can either wait until the <code>vim-gitgutter</code> step
(coming right up in 4 steps), or you can run this command (the one at the bottom
of the screenshot):</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-15.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-15.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>To make the change permanent, you&rsquo;ll have to add that line (<code>:hi clear
SignColumn</code>) to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>.</p>

<h2>8. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/fd2c49c">Plugins vim-easytags and tagbar</a></h2>

<p>After this step, you should be able to bring up a split pane view that shows
your functions, variables, and other identifiers by pressing <code>\b</code>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-16.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-16.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>If you enabled mouse reporting, you should be able to click on the things in the
pane and jump to the appropriate place in the file. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend that
you read the help for all the keybindings and actions you can use with it.</p>

<h2>9. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/80db74f">Plugin ctrlp</a></h2>

<p>When <code>CtrlP</code> is installed, you can press <code>Ctrl + P</code> to bring up a list of files.
As you type, the list will be filtered to only those that &ldquo;fuzzy match&rdquo; what
you&rsquo;ve typed in. As you can see, I typed in <code>mc</code>, which matched <code>vimrc.vim</code> and
<code>main.c</code>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-17.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-17.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>10. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/8d4223f">Plugin A.vim</a></h2>

<p>This plugin introduces a number of commands that you can read in the
documentation that enable opening &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; files, like C/C++ header files,
really quickly. I&rsquo;ve run <code>:AV</code> here as an example of one of the commands it
installs, which opens the alternate file in a vertical split pane.</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-18.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-18.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>11. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/1e5757e">Plugins vim-gitgutter and vim-fugitive</a></h2>

<p><code>vim-gitgutter</code> is really handy: it shows you a <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or <code>~</code> next to lines
that have been added, removed, or modified. This is good for both identifying
the pieces of code that have changed while you&rsquo;re working on a file as well as
reminding yourself that you have changes that need to be commited.</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-19.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-19.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p>Speaking of committing files, <code>vim-fugitive</code> lets you make Git commits from
right within Vim. Simply run <code>:Gcommit</code> to bring up a split pane where you can
craft your commit message:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-20.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-20.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<p><code>vim-fugitive</code> can do much more than just make commits. Be sure to read the
appropriate documentation to figure out what sorts of cool things you can do!</p>

<h2>12. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/2fe0507">Plugin delimitMate</a></h2>

<p>Finally, using <code>delimitMate</code> you should be able to type an opening delimiter and
have the closing one be inserted automatically. Here&rsquo;s an example on
parentheses:</p>

<p><a href="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-21.png"><img src="/images/vim-as-an-ide/shot-21.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>13. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/b185e9f">Plugin vim-superman</a></h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve added the appropriate function to your shell initialization file
(<code>~/.bashrc</code>, etc.), you should be able to run <code>vman &lt;command&gt;</code> to open man
pages. Here&rsquo;s an example on <code>vman 3 printf</code>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/printf.3.png"><img src="/images/printf.3.png" alt="Vim as an IDE" /></a></p>

<h2>14. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/44f5225">Plugin vim-tmux-navigator</a></h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to show here, as this step is mostly just introducing
keybindings. If you use <code>tmux</code>, make sure to copy the appropriate snippet into
your <code>~/.tmux.conf</code> to be able to jump between tmux and Vim splits with no added
effort.</p>

<h2>15. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/5ba534e">Syntax plugins</a></h2>

<p>No screenshots again. What syntax highlighting plugins you end up installing is
largely up to you.</p>

<h2>16. <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/commit/9089a95">Add all the extra plugins that I use</a></h2>

<p>For these plugins, be sure to check the documentation. Most of them have
screenshots that show what they look like when installed and configured
correctly.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! I can only take you so far in making your Vim awesome. You have to
take yourself the rest of the way by investing a little bit of effort into

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve already written about how I develop LaTeX offline in Vim using GNU Make.
Recently, though, I found a tool that implements another feature that GUI
editors had to themselves: splitting panes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">Offline LaTeX Development</a></h2>

<p>If you missed it, check out my previous post here before reading on. There&rsquo;s a
lot of handy stuff there!</p>

<h2>Split Panes</h2>

<p>Out of the box, tools like ShareLaTeX and TeXShop feature split pane editing:
you can have your LaTeX on one half of the screen and the PDF on the other.
Previously, I justified not having this feature with the reasoning that the
<code>:WV</code> binding (something I explained <a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">here</a>) immediately opened up the
PDF and the windows switched.</p>

<p>However, I read about a tool called <a href="http://ianyh.com/amethyst/">Amethyst</a> on Hacker News the
other day and immediately realized it&rsquo;s potential for improving my LaTeX setup.
Amethyst is a tool that strives to be a tiling window manager like xmonad for OS
X. At times it falls short of this goal, but for the most part it works really
well. Just open up two apps, like MacVim and Preview, and it&rsquo;ll show them
side-by-side with no added effort. There are also plenty of keybindings to
manipulate the window arrangements.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what the new setup looks like:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/latex-amethyst.png"><img src="/images/latex-amethyst.png"></a></p>

<p>After looking into it a little more, it looks like there are other OS X tools
for spitting the screen into two panes, like <a href="http://www.bettertouchtool.net/">BetterTouchTool</a>, though I
haven&rsquo;t actually tried any of them out.</p>

    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/2014/12/20/vim-as-a-man-page-viewer/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-20T21:17:46-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2014/12/20/vim-as-a-man-page-viewer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man pages are an essential part of every developer&rsquo;s workflow. Unfortunately,
the default system pager <code>less</code> isn&rsquo;t the best interface. That&rsquo;s why I wrote a
Vim plugin and a short shell function to take care of opening man pages in Vim.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Plugin</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re eager to dive right into the source or to install the plugin, head on
over to the <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-superman">GitHub repository</a>. It&rsquo;s a whopping 32 SLOC, so feel
free to peek under the hood.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;But Jake, <code>man</code> works just fine for me, why would I
switch?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad you asked!</p>

<h3>Mouse Support</h3>

<p>The first reason why I was interested in getting man pages to open in Vim was
because I wanted to be able to scroll with the mouse. When I have to read man
pages for a long time, usually as a part of some more all-encompasing bit of
research, I find scrolling to be a much better interface for quickly perusing
the content of a man page.</p>

<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p>As it turns out, man pages have a syntax to them, and Vim does a pretty
excellent job at highlighting them. Rather than talk about it, here are some
screenshots. Note how code samples (C system calls and library functions) are
also syntax highlighted appropriately.</p>

<pre><code class="bash Example 1">vman vim
</code></pre>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/vim.1.png"><img src="/images/vim.1.png"></a></p>

<pre><code class="bash Example 2">vman 3 printf
</code></pre>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/printf.3.png"><img src="/images/printf.3.png"></a></p>

<h3>All the benefits of Vim</h3>

<p>While <code>less</code> makes a good effort to emulate certain Vim keybindings (or maybe
it&rsquo;s the other way around, I don&rsquo;t know which came first), <code>less</code> certainly
falls short of the full power of Vim.</p>

<p>For example, once you&rsquo;ve opened a man page in Vim, you can open a new tab or
split side-by-side with the man page. Especially if you&rsquo;re switching between Vim
and the man page often, being able to open man pages in tabs or splits is
invaluable.</p>

<h2>Mine doesn&rsquo;t look like yours!</h2>

<p>A couple of my other plugins are showing in the screenshots above. I&rsquo;m using the
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Solarized Dark color scheme</a>, the plugin
<a href="https://github.com/bling/vim-airline">vim-airline</a> to take over the statuslines at the very top and
bottom, and iTerm2 on Mac OS X 10.10.</p>

<p>You can see my complete configuration <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>As a matter of fact, this was my first Vim plugin! If you notice anything out of
place, even if it&rsquo;s a small detail, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. Make no assumptions
about the reasoning behind why certain decisions were made, because I have none
XD</p>

    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-06T18:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While online clients like ShareLaTeX or writeLaTeX are popular for getting started with LaTeX quickly, developing LaTeX locally with Vim and the command line is my preferred LaTeX workflow. In this post, I&rsquo;ll describe the changes I&rsquo;ve made that make working with LaTeX on the command line a seamless experience.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Install LaTeX</h2>

<p>Obviously, to work with LaTeX locally, you&rsquo;ll need LaTeX installed. To check if you already have it installed, you can run <code>which pdflatex</code>. If it&rsquo;s installed, this command will tell you the path to program. Otherwise, it won&rsquo;t print anything.</p>

<h3>On Linux</h3>

<p>Installing LaTeX on Linux isn&rsquo;t too bad. Usually it&rsquo;s included in your distribution&rsquo;s package manager. I&rsquo;ll be focusing on OS X for the majority of this post though, so Google around if you end up having trouble.</p>

<h3>On OS X</h3>

<p>To install LaTeX on a Mac, we&rsquo;ll be installing MacTeX, which includes the command line LaTeX utilities as well as a couple graphical clients for LaTeX development. You can try compiling from source, but as Homebrew points out when you try to <code>brew install linux</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="plain brew install latex">$ brew install latex
Error: No available formula for latex
Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of patches,
and only builds 32-bit (and thus can't use Homebrew deps on Snow Leopard.)

We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/
</code></pre>

<p>With that in mind, head on over to <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">http://www.tug.org/mactex/</a> and download the file <code>MacTeX.pkg</code>. Once this has downloaded and you&rsquo;ve clicked through the installer, you should be ready to go with LaTeX. Verify this by running <code>which pdflatex</code> again.</p>

<h2>Use Vim</h2>

<p>The biggest productivity improvement you gain from developing LaTeX locally is that you get to use Vim. Make sure you have a nice colorscheme for both your terminal and for Vim. <strong>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to make your terminal look nice</strong>: you want to enjoy your terminal experience, and this is one of the easiest ways to do so.</p>

<h2>Use Make</h2>

<p>Compiling LaTeX is pretty straightforward. To generate a PDF, all you have to do is run the command</p>

<pre><code class="bash pdflatex">$ pdflatex &lt;myfile&gt;.tex
</code></pre>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll get a file called <code>&lt;myfile&gt;.pdf</code> in the current directory, plus some intermediate files. We can go one step further and put a bunch of useful build targets into a Makefile and use it to build our PDF:</p>

<pre><code class="make LaTeX Makefile https://gist.github.com/jez/b248a409d19c9f1c94cd"># NOTE: Change "written" to the name of your TeX file with no extension
TARGET=written

all: $(TARGET).pdf

## Generalized rule: how to build a .pdf from each .tex
LATEXPDFS=$(patsubst %.tex,%.pdf,$(wildcard *.tex))
$(LATEXPDFS): %.pdf: %.tex
  pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode $(patsubst %.pdf,%.tex,$@)

clean:
  rm *.aux *.log || true

veryclean: clean
  rm $(TARGET).pdf

view: $(TARGET).pdf
  if [ "Darwin" = "$(shell uname)" ]; then open $(TARGET).pdf ; else evince $(TARGET).pdf ; fi

submit: $(TARGET).pdf
  cp $(TARGET).pdf ../

print: $(TARGET).pdf
  lpr $(TARGET).pdf

.PHONY: all clean veryclean view print
</code></pre>

<p>If you save this to a file called <code>Makefile</code> in the same directory as your LaTeX file, we can just run <code>make</code> instead of running <code>pdflatex &lt;myfile&gt;.tex</code>!</p>

<p>As you can see, there are a bunch of other handy targets here:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>make clean</code> will remove all intermediate files that are created.</li>
<li><code>make veryclean</code> will remove all intermediate files and the compiled PDF file.</li>
<li><code>make view</code> will compile the file and then open it up in a PDF viewer (if you&rsquo;re on OS X, or on Linux and have <code>evince</code> installed).</li>
<li><code>make print</code> will send your document to the default printer with the default options for that printer.</li>
<li><code>make submit</code> will copy your file into the parent directory. This is handy when you&rsquo;re working in a subfolder on an assignment to isolate the intermediate files, but your class has provided a handin script that needs the PDF file to be in the parent directory.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Workflow Tips</h2>

<p>Right now, our workflow looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create TeX file</li>
<li>Edit in Vim</li>
<li>Switch to terminal</li>
<li>Run make view to compile and view</li>
</ul>


<p>We can actually optimize this workflow to one less step: we don&rsquo;t have to get out of Vim to run make!</p>

<p>Vim has a command <code>:make</code> that will look for a Makefile in the current directory and run it&rsquo;s <code>all</code> target. It also takes a target as an optional argument, so we can do <code>:make view</code> to compile and view the document from within Vim!</p>

<p>Taking this one step further, we can add a command to shorten this. If we add</p>

<pre><code class="vim Save, Compile and View in Vim">command WV w | make view
</code></pre>

<p>to our <code>.vimrc</code>, we&rsquo;ll only have to type <code>:WV</code> to save, compile, and view our PDF output.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! I like this experience for a bunch of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s faster</strong>. Compiling LaTeX without having to wait for a web client to load is really nice.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s more stable</strong>. You can still edit, compile, and view your work if you don&rsquo;t have access to the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s faster</strong>. Using Vim to edit text is much more convenient than a standard text editor.</li>
</ul>


<p>Do you have a LaTeX tip, a fancier Makefile, or a favorite vim plugin for LaTeX? Share it in the comments!</p>
